# Technical Documentation for MyTestClass

## Introduction
The `MyTestClass` is a JUnit 5 test class designed to test basic arithmetic operations. It includes test methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. This documentation provides an overview of the test class and its individual test methods.

## MyTestClass
`MyTestClass` is the main test class containing four test methods, each testing a specific arithmetic operation.

### `testAddition()`
This test method evaluates the addition operation by adding 2 and 2 and asserts that the result is equal to 4.

### `testSubtraction()`
This test method evaluates the subtraction operation by subtracting 3 from 5 and asserts that the result is equal to 2.

### `testMultiplication()`
This test method evaluates the multiplication operation by multiplying 4 by 3 and asserts that the result is equal to 12.

### `testDivision()`
This test method evaluates the division operation by dividing 10 by 2 and asserts that the result is equal to 5.

## Test Assertions
Each test method uses JUnit 5's `assertEquals()` method to verify that the computed result matches the expected result. If the actual result differs from the expected result, the test will fail, indicating that there is an issue with the corresponding arithmetic operation.

## Running the Tests
To run these tests, you need to set up a JUnit 5 environment in your Java project. Make sure you have JUnit 5 properly configured, and then you can execute the tests. When you run the tests, JUnit will compare the actual results with the expected results, and any discrepancies will be reported.

## Conclusion
The `MyTestClass` serves as a basic example of writing unit tests with JUnit 5 for arithmetic operations. It demonstrates how to use JUnit 5 annotations and assertions to ensure the correctness of your code.

Feel free to expand upon this test class and add more test methods to cover other scenarios or functions in your application.
